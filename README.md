🚀 Team Progress on Features

We are currently in the transition phase between Design and Development. Below is the detailed status of our progress for the "Vexel" application:

1. UI/UX Design (Figma)
We have completed the High-Fidelity designs for the majority of the application modules. Our focus has been on ensuring a consistent visual identity and a user-friendly experience for instructors.

Completed Designs:
- Auth & User: Login Page, Register Page, Edit Profile Page.
- Dashboard: Main Dashboard (Home).
- Rubric Management: Rubric Library Page, Create New Rubric Page.
- Grading System: Grading Submission Page, Student History Page, Reports Page.

Work In Progress:
- Landing Page.
- Grading Assignment Page (Execution/Detail View).
- User Profile Page (View Mode).

2. Backend & AI Development
The core logic of our application is functional. We have successfully implemented the backend structure and its integration with the AI engine.

- AI Logic: The AI processing logic is fully operational. The system can successfully accept rubric parameters and evaluate submitted work.
- Integration Status: The backend is connected to the AI service. We are currently using a temporary interface to verify the logic.
- Pending: We are finalizing the API Key configuration to prepare the system for full-scale usage.

3. Next Steps: Frontend Implementation
With the Figma designs nearing completion and the backend logic ready, our team's immediate next step is **UI Slicing**. We will begin translating our high-fidelity designs into the actual frontend code to replace the temporary testing interface.
